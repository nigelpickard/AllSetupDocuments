1. create a new repository in github without any ignores, readmes, etc, e.g. nothing should be checked.
2. create in Eclipse your project, e.g. AbstractFactoryPattern
3. go to command line.  In the project directory do:
	i. git init
	ii. touch README.md
	iii. git add README.md
	iv. git commit -m "first commit"
	v. git remote add origin https://github.com/nigelpickard/HibernateExamples.git
	vi. git push -u origin master

where the "AbstractFactoryPattern" is replaced with the appropriate project you are working with.

4. go back to Eclipse.  You may need to use Team->share (just use the same settings, as it says create or use a git repository at the same location).  Once this is done, try changing a file and committing it to the local repo.  Once that is done, push to the remote (this may involve setting up a push ref to do so).

We should be done!
